1. The application must give the users the ability to add delete and change the quantity of items in a list.
To address this requirement I added operations in the Grocery List  class to delete and change quantity along with the add items class

2. Database class created with item and item type

3. Users can add items to a list using the add item class.In the add item class they are able to select the quantity and search using the hierarchical list.

4. Users are able to add an item by searching by its name using the search name function under the add items class

5. Lists are saved automatically when checked off using the check_off operation in the grocery list item

6. Users are able to check off lists using the check_off operation. This is different than the delete_item() operation. 

7. Users can clear all the check off marks in the list by using the clear_list() operation 

8. Check-off marks being persistent addressed in the various list management operations

9. Grocery List uses the grouping algorithm that will present the items in a grouped type.

10. Multiple lists supported by the list management operations.

11. The User interface being intuitive and responsive not considered because it does not affect the design directly.
