## 1. Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions

- The user must be logged into the GroceryListApp to access and manipulate grocery lists.
- The application assumes users have an understanding of basic application interactions (e.g., navigating menus, selecting options).
- The application is intended for use on both desktop and mobile platforms.

### 1.2 Constraints

- The application must adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding user data storage and usage.
- The design must ensure smooth and efficient performance across different device types and network conditions.
- The system must be highly available and reliable to provide a seamless user experience.

### 1.3 System Environment

- The application must operate on multiple platforms, including web and mobile.
- The backend uses a relational database to store grocery lists and related data.
- The application integrates with an authentication service for user login.

## 2. Architectural Design

### 2.1 Component Diagram

- The system consists of three main components:
  - **User Interface**: Handles user interactions and displays information to the user.
  - **Backend Server**: Processes user requests, performs business logic, and interacts with the database.
  - **Database**: Stores and retrieves grocery lists and related data.
- The diagram would illustrate the flow of data between these components, showing how user requests are handled by the server and how data is retrieved from or stored in the database.

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram

- The user interface component will be deployed on the user's device, such as a web browser or mobile app.
- The backend server and database will be deployed on a cloud server or data center.
- The deployment diagram would show the relationship and communication flow between these components.

## 3. Low-Level Design

### 3.1 Class Diagram

- The class diagram would include classes such as `User`, `GroceryList`, and `Item`.
- Relationships between classes, such as associations and aggregations, would be shown.
- Classes would have attributes and methods representing the properties and behaviors of the objects.

### 3.2 Other Diagrams

- **Sequence Diagrams**: Show the flow of interactions between objects for each use case, such as creating a grocery list or adding an item.
- **State Diagrams**: Represent the state transitions for objects like `GroceryList` and `Item` throughout their lifecycle.

## 4. User Interface Design

- **Create Grocery List**: The user interface allows the user to use one of the ten premade grocery lists whenever they want to create a new grocery list.
- **View Grocery List**: The user interface displays a list of grocery lists for the user to select and view.
- **Add/Remove Item**: The interface allows the user to add or remove items from a selected grocery list.
- **Rename List**: The user can rename a list by entering a new name.
- **Change Item Quantity**: The interface provides options to adjust the quantity of an item in a list.
- **Graphical Mockups**: Include graphical mockups of the key screens for user interactions.
