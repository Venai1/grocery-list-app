An app that the user can use to create, edit, and delete multiple grocery lists. You can search for the products you need easily and add them to your list quickly.

## 2 Process Description

- User creates a list: 
    A user can create multiple grocery lists for different occasions. Each list will have its own name set by the user. User would need to input a name for each list they create. When the user is done giving the list a name a new list with that name will be created.  
- User renames a list:
    A user can rename an already existing lists name. User would need to add a new name for their list to replace the old one. When the user is done inputing a new name for the list the lists name will be changed.
- User deletes a list:
    A user can delete an existing list. If the user wants to remove an existing list this they can delete the list whenever they want. It will remove all information about the list. The user only needs to press the delete button and press ok to delete the list they want to remove. Once the user deletes the list it will not exist anymore.
- User selects a list:
    A user can select an existing list and switch over to it. If the user has multiple lists created they can switch to a different list. The user needs to press a button that would allow them to browse their existing lists. Once they pick an existing list it will switch over to that list. The output would be switching to the list the user has chosen.
- User edits a list:
    A user can edit an existing list. This allows the user to change the quantity of items, remove items, and add items to a list. For quantity of items the user has to input the amount of the item they want. To remove an item the user has to click a remove symbol. To add an item to the list the user has to click the add button, search for the item they want to add, click on it then it will be added to the list.
- User adds a item to the grocery list:
    The user can add an item to the grocery list. Once the item is added to the list the user can choose the quantity for the item. The user clicks a button to add an item to the list. Then they will search for the item they are looking for and input a quantity for the item. Once this is all done the output will be the item's name and the quantity for the item.
- User deletes a item from the grocery list:
    The user can delete an item from the grocery list. If an item exists in the list the user can remove it from the list at any time. The user clicks a button to delete the item from the list. The output will be the item and its quantity being removed from the list.
- User checking off an item in grocery list:
    The user can check off an item that they have already acquired from the grocery list. Once the user decides they already have the item the wanted they can check off the item on the list to show the item has already been acquired. The user clicks a button to check off an item. The output will be the item having a check mark next to it to represent it being acquired.
