# Test Plan

**Team 6**

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

System testing-
Checking the full total system to verify functionality and completeness of the project.
Will be done at the completion of the construction.
Reference the requirements in order to verify completeness.
Will be performed by the designated QA person on the team (Venai Seepersaud) who will advocate for any quality changes needed.

Regression testing-
Whenever new functionality is added to the code check to verify no new errors have been introduced.
There will be a regression suite of test cases to cover in order to ensure no bugs on any of the other sections of code.
Will cover all areas of the code on a very high level to ensure no bugs.
Will be performed by the designated QA person (Venai Seepersaud) after any large changes are made.

### 1.2 Test Selection

Unit Testing -
White box.
Verify all possible outputs that can be given for condition in a method is implemented correctly.

Integration Testing-
Black box.
Just look at input and output between two modules.

System Testing -
Exploratory testing/Black box.
Reference app result to requirements. Consider enhancement requests in this stage also.

Regression Testing -
Black box.
Just verify input and output on all parts of the project on a high level to ensure no bugs have been introduced with changes.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

Quality of test cases results in consideration of the 'happy path' of the program. Test cases that ensure that the main requirements of the software are passing.
System testing is done on a high level utilizing the main requirements of the software is good.

Integration and Regression testing is testing that should be done whenever changes are made. This ensures high quality in the form of not introducing bugs with new changes.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked using our teams discord channel, we will create a separate section just for bug requests.
Bug requests must be clear and concise given with steps to reproduce, expected results and actual results.
Whenever a bug is completed the message should be replied to with the changes made (commit ID) and changes must be verified by the person who submitted the bug request.

Enhancement requests should be looked at but not prioritized over main functionality of the software.

### 1.5 Technology

The team intends to use JUnit as our testing framework.
